 # Note: This library has been superceded by [sync-request-curl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sync-request-curl) ([Github](https://github.com/nktnet1/sync-request-curl)). It is no longer maintained and should not be used.

# Sync Request HTTP
- Modelled after [sync-request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sync-request)
- Calls [curl](https://curl.se/) through [child_process.execSync](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_processexecsynccommand-options)

## Note:
- Use [sync-request-curl](https://github.com/nktnet1/sync-request-curl) instead!
